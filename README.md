# signals-planner
A "research" project for my own personal curiosities.

# TODO
- empty version history and make sure there's nothing too specific in the project

# Installing, running, and building
- To install `npm install`. Note that link calculation requires binaries from `https://github.com/Jompda/itm-webassembly`. To get them you have to build the `itm-webassembly` project. Linking the files via npm can be done by running `npm link` in the `itm-webassemply`-folder and then running `npm link itm-webassembly` in the `signals-planner` directory. Note that any npm package updates reset the link so it must be redone every time.
- Before running, configure API keys in `options.js`:
```js
export default {
    mapboxToken: 'MAPBOX_TOKEN',
    MMLApiKey: 'MML_API_KEY'
}
```
- To run a local development server `npm run serve`.
